after setting up initial dialogflow agent:

low hanging fruit
- change audio processing to serverside
- use dialogflow cx instead of es

hanging slightly higher
- front end for user to interact via webpage/existing app (probably using dialogflow integrations) instead of python codebase

higher
- app development



openai model:

i would like to use gpt to construct the google calendar api request sent in step 2. so, the overall process will be 
1) user asks question
2) question is sent to gpt with instructions to construct a google calendar api request if applicable and return it, if not a scheduling question no need to do so - question is answered and conversation continues (back to step 1)
3) if it is a scheduling question, gpt returns the google calendar api request
4) code makes the google calendar api request
5) results of calendar api request are appended to original question, and sent to gpt which answers it using relevant calendary information and conversation continues (back to step 1)

right now, i have a script which only does
1) user asks question
2) question is sent to gpt which answers it, and conversation continues (back to step 1)

can you help to a high level modification of my existing script to implement the calendar functionality i described:

** insert v6 script **
