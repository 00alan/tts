openai version todo:
- using o1 or o3-mini rather than gpt-4o (right now don't have high enough openai account tier)

dialogflow todo (put on pause for now)
- change audio processing to serverside
- use dialogflow cx instead of es
- front end for user to interact via webpage/existing app (probably using dialogflow integrations) instead of python codebase
