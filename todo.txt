dialogflow todo

after setting up initial dialogflow agent:

low hanging fruit
- change audio processing to serverside
- use dialogflow cx instead of es

hanging slightly higher
- front end for user to interact via webpage/existing app (probably using dialogflow integrations) instead of python codebase

higher
- app development



openai script todo:

i already have a working script which invokes openai api:
1) user asks question
2) question is sent to gpt which answers it, responseds, and conversation continues (back to step 1)

but i would like to modify it in order to set up the following functionality: 
1) user asks question
2) question is sent to gpt, along with appended with instructions to first decide whether the question is pertaining to scheduling, and if so construct a google calendar api request in correct format if and return it, if not a scheduling question no need to do so - question is answered as usual and conversation continues (back to step 1)
3) if it is a scheduling question, gpt returns the google calendar api request
4) code makes the google calendar api request
5) results of calendar api request are appended to original question, and sent to gpt which answers it using relevant calendary information and conversation continues (back to step 1)


note that i do not want my script to be involved in any decicion making, all decision making is offloaded to gpt by appending instructions to the message delivered to gpt.

can you modify my existing script (attached below) in order to achieve the desired affect

** insert v6 script **
